#Initialization
see where you initialize the variables.
If you want the variables to reinitialize every time before some operation, do so.
eg. Strings problem. Here do not initialize before the first for. It has to reset every time after the new string is read. If you do it after reading t,the 
output acts on all the input strings instead of acting on them one by one.
t = int(input("enter the number of strings"))
for i in range(0,t):
    s = input("enter the strings")
	s1=""
    s2=""
    for i in range(0,len(s)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            s1= s1+s[i]
        else:
            s2= s2+s[i]
    print(s1," ",s2)
